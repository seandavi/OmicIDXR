Description: This R package accesses the OmicIDX project. 
    OmicIDX parses and then serves public genomics repository metadata. 
    These metadata are growing quickly, updated often, and are now very large when 
    taken as a whole. Because of the interrelated nature of the metadata and the 
    myriad approaches and use cases that exist, including search, bulk download, 
    and even data mining, we serve the data via a GraphQL endpoint.
    Currently, OmicIDX contains the SRA and Biosample metadata sets. These overlap 
    with each other, but SRA metadata contains deeper metadata than Biosample data on 
    the same samples. Biosample, on the other hand, contains many more samples and 
    currently includes metadata about a subset of NCBI GEO, all SRA samples, and some 
    additional samples from projects like Genbank.
